History:

VHFtoN2k was my first attempt to make an NMEA0183 to NMEA2000 converter
using a cheap Arduino mini pro. I soon realized this wasn't capable of 
doing such task and I therefore started looking at the also cheap
STM32F103 modules available at e.g. ebay

At first my idea was to stay with the Arduino SDK, but I soon realized 
the STM32F103 wasn't too well supported - at least not when it came to
3. party libraries.

I further more found the Arduino SDK difficult to work with. 
Being used to eclipse and the freedom you here have it is difficult to
go with something that primitive.

Furthermore I missed possibilities for designing in threads because it
really ease the implementation of even systems so simple like this

Functionality:

Basically the project implements a replacement for an Actisense AIS reader.
I need to be able to feed my Vulcan-7 NMEA2000 GSP with AIS coming from 
my NMEA0183 only VHF.
